                El Salvador is home to some of the finest specialty coffees in
                the world, grown by small farmers who, over generations,
                developed a unique culture around the land, the people, and the
                processes for savoring the tastes and subtle notes of a fine cup
                of coffee. Our BitCafe Project emerged out of this generational
                passion for fine coffee culture. Jorge Rubio, a son of Salvador,
                educated in the United States and Europe, and employed by big
                tech as a team leader, found himself inevitably drawn back to
                his native land and culture, with a passion for bringing fine
                Salvadoran coffee to the markets he had spent much of his life
                inâ€¦the US and Europe. The nagging challenge was how?

                Coffee, a highly sought-after commodity worldwide, has come to
                symbolize the dominance of corporate cartels that manipulate
                global supply chains. In the pursuit of catering to consumer
                convenience, these cartels exploit small farmers who diligently
                cultivate environmentally sustainable, top-notch specialty
                coffee. The farmers are forced into the clutches of massive
                conglomerates that depress prices during harvest time, all to
                benefit the shareholders of their global food brands. The
                existing system, based on a centralized fiat standard, proves
                inadequate for small farmers seeking to carve a niche among
                discerning coffee enthusiasts and connoisseurs.

                Jorge Rubio, back in El Salvador, began a new venture. By 2016,
                he envisioned a direct peer-to-peer system for his BioKrop
                Project and Dos Mundos Cafe to offer exceptional specialty
                coffee blends at fair prices, benefiting small farmers. In 2019,
                Dos Mundos Cafe in El Zonte, or Bitcoin Beach, pioneered with
                the first bitcoin ATM, selling beansfor-sats to coffee
                enthusiasts worldwide. Aligned with bitcoins recognition as
                legal tender, Jorge and Dos Mundos led in global payments and
                education, collaborating with Hope House, Casa del Bitcoin, and
                MiPrimerBitcoin to share specialty coffee and bitcoin
                principles.

                Embarking on a journey in early 2021, in order to better
                understand the modern global money system, Steve Wilmarth
                explored El Salvadors future economy based on hard money
                concepts. He realized the grassroots efforts in El Zonte could
                transform a flawed monetary system for marginalized,
                non-privileged communities. The BitCafe Project emerged from
                discussions with coffee growers, laborers, activists, and
                bitcoiners who envision a fairer world with economic
                opportunities and property rights for future generations.
                History teaches us to challenge the status quo and embrace new
                ideas based on facts, driving human progress and civilization.
                This is the inspiration for the BitCafe Project.

                The BitCafe Project unites a superior cafe experience with
                digital currency and blockchain education. It combines Tierra
                Bendita and Dos Mundos seed-to-cup expertise, fostering a global
                grassroots movement towards adopting the bitcoin standard. This
                initiative promotes exploration, knowledge, and community
                progress. We honor the pioneers, mathematicians, and activists
                who came before us as we create a space for people to gather,
                savor specialty coffee, initiate discussions on transformative
                technologies shaping global transactions, and actively
                contribute to community development.
